 * something remounted, because the client's freshness window is 60s and nothing
 * told it otherwise. Shortening that window would have meant every open tab
 * re-fetching every board forever; this replaces the question "has anything
 * changed?" with the server saying so once, to exactly the people looking at it.
 *
 * ONE OUTBOUND EVENT. Every change rides the same `crm:change` envelope rather
 * than a bespoke event name per entity, so the client bridge is one table
 * instead of forty listeners that drift apart. Adding an entity is a row here
